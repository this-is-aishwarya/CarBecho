# CarBecho- Car Price Prediction System
This project presents a vehicle price prediction system by using the supervised machine learning technique. The system takes in account factors such as vehicle's transmision, mileage, distance travelled etc. and predicts the selling price of the car.

## Model Used
The project uses multiple linear regression as the machine learning
prediction method which offered 98% prediction precision. Using multiple linear
regression, there are multiple independent variables but one and only one dependent
variable whose actual and predicted values are compared to find precision of results. This
project proposes a system where price is a dependent variable which is predicted, and this
price is derived from factors like vehicleâ€™s model, make, version, transmission ,mileage,
ownership and distance travelled.
